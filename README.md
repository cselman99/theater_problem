ASSUMPTIONS:
* Party size is limited to an entire row... would be rare to see during COVID
* Assume individuals would prefer seating near the back rather than the front
* Assume the input file may be blank, but if filled, contains correctly formatted data
    - e.g. R001 6
* Assume there can be no duplicate reservations. A set is used to enforce unique entries.
* Mimimum buffer of 3 seats and/or 1 row
* Assume requests are fulfilled in the order they were received. (Not working to maximize occupants
    in the room but rather seat customers in a safe/orderly fashion)
* Assume that order of requests is correctly reflected in the input document 
    - "order of the lines in the file reflects the order in which the reservation requests were received."
* Assume that there may be an overflow of requests (not enough seating in the theater).
    - Later parties would not receive seats


BUILD INSTRUCTIONS:
Create constants â€“ ROWS and SEATS to represent the dimensions of the theater. (Allows for generalization)
Create 2D array of size ROWS x SEATS initialized with 0s.
Parse input file specified in first command line arg.
For all items parsed from input file, process request by finding first open seats.
    Searching back to front, left to right, accounting for separation.
When seats are found, update 2D array with 1s in the respective locations.
Write to output file with results
(Optionally print 2D list for visual representation)
Print full path to output file.


OTHER METHODS:
Search middle rows first, filling towards the back, then fill towards the front.
    (This method assumes the middle section is the most sought after, followed by the back, then the front)
Sort requests by party size, adding big parties first before considering smaller parties. 
    (Optimization for revenue)


RUN INSTRUCTIONS:
python3 driver.py path
* NOTE: path argument is the destination of the reservations file *
View "output.txt" for listed results, and terminal for grid view of seating chart and testing results
